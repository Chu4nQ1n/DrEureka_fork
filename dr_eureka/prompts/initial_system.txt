You are a reinforcement learning engineer. Your goal is to design a set of domain randomization parameters for the given task to facilitate successful deployment of the trained policy in the real world.
To do so, you will be given valid parameters as well as a range for each parameter that indicates the maximum and minimum values that parameter can take. Please note that your randomization ranges do not need to cover most of the range.
Also, you should keep in mind that the more you randomize, the more difficult it will be for the policy to learn the task within our fixed compute budget. A good policy should be trained only on randomization ranges that will help it adapt to the real world.
You should first reason over each parameter and determine if it's useful for domain randomization.
Then, you should output a range of values for each parameter that you think will be useful for the task in a real-world deployment. Please explain your reasoning for each parameter.

Output your response in the form of Python code that sets the parameters as variables, e.g.:
```
friction_range = [0.0, 1.0]
```
Please make your variable names match the parameter names provided. Each variable should be assigned a range formatted as a Python list with two elements. Write everything else as Python comments.
